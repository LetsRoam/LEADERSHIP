					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<p>
						The former capital of Japan, Kyoto is still recognized today as the
						center of ancient Japanese culture. It is one of the few areas of
						Japan that has retained its historical traditions and appearance.
						Home to about 20% of Japan’s National Treasures and 15% of Japan’s
						Important Cultural Properties, it is easy to see why so many flock
						here annually for a trip back in time to experience the history of
						Kyoto. Kyoto is the birthplace of many of Japan’s traditional arts,
						many of which are still actively performed and practiced. Yet while
						many are aware of the famous shrines, temples, and traditional arts
						of Kyoto, how many people understand the significance of these
						places? The former capital of Japan, Kyoto is still recognized today

					<h2>HISTORY</h2>
					<p>
						The history of Kyoto goes all the way back to the 8th century. The
						city was built as the capital of Japan at that time and was home to
						the Imperial Court until 1868 when it moved to Tokyo. No longer the
						capital of the country today, it is still the capital of the
						prefecture and superior to Tokyo when it comes to historical sites,
						relics, and monuments. Because it has managed to retain a charming
						traditional atmosphere in many neighborhoods it draws millions of
						domestic as well as international tourists each year. We have great
						package tours that include Archeologists have found sites that date
						back all the way to the Jomon and Yayoi period of more than 10.000
						years ago, but it wasn't until the 6th century that the area has
						been colonized more permanently. This was the Hata clan who was
						originally from Korea. These people were silk farmers and became
						wealthy because of the trade in silk products. They built their
						family temple in the Western part of what would become Kyoto, as
						other powerful clans started moving into the northern part of the
						area. <br />
						<br />
						<br />
						Kyoto as a Capital: the Heian Era <br />
						<br />
						<br />
						Kyoto became the capital city of Japan in 794 after Nara and has
						been built to resemble the capital of China during the Tang dynasty
						(today's Xi'an). The city was rectangular in shape and was 4.5 by
						5.2 kilometers big. The city slowly started to expand towards the
						east, and powerful clans built their residences in central locations
						of the new capital city. The Heian period was a relatively peaceful
						era compared to what came after when the balance of power shifted
						from Kyoto to the east of Japan.
