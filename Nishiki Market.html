					<h2>Nishiki Market</h2>
					<p>
						<br />
						<a href="https://www.kyoto-nishiki.or.jp/">Nishiki Market</a>
						(錦市場, Nishiki Ichiba) is a narrow, five block long shopping
						street lined by more than one hundred shops and restaurants. Known
						as "Kyoto's Kitchen", this lively retail market specializes in all
						things food related, like fresh seafood, produce, knives and
						cookware, and is a great place to find seasonal foods and Kyoto
						specialties, such as Japanese sweets, pickles, dried seafood and
						sushi. Nishiki Market has a pleasant but busy atmosphere that is
						inviting to those who want to explore the variety of culinary
						delights that Kyoto is famous for. The stores range from small
						narrow stalls to larger two story shops. Most specialize in a
						particular type of food, and almost everything sold at the market is
						locally produced and procured.
						<br />
						Nishiki Market (二条城, Nijōjō) was built in 1603 as the Kyoto
						residence of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first shogun of the Edo Period
						(1603-1867). His grandson Iemitsu completed the castle's palace
						buildings 23 years later and further expanded the castle by adding a
						five story castle keep. After the Tokugawa Shogunate fell in 1867,
						Nishiki Market was used as an imperial palace for a while before
						being donated to the city and opened up to the public as a historic
						site. Its palace buildings are arguably the best surviving examples
						of castle palace architecture of Japan's feudal era, and the castle
						was designated a UNESCO world heritage site in 1994. Nishiki Market
						can be divided into three areas: the Honmaru (main circle of
						defense), the Ninomaru (secondary circle of defense) and some
						gardens around them. The entire castle grounds and the Honmaru are
						surrounded by stone walls and moats.
